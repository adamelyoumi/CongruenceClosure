# Congruence Closure Algorithm Implementation

This project is focused on implementing and visualizing the Congruence Closure (CC) Algorithm in a step-by-step manner. The primary objective is to develop an interactive and educational tool that simplifies understanding of the algorithmâ€™s mechanics. Designed for students and other interested learners, the tool allows users to input constraints, observe the formation of equivalence classes, and detect conflicts dynamically. It serves as both a learning aid and a practical demonstration of CC in action.
